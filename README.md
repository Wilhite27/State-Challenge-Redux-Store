# State-Challenge-Redux-Store
An app that allows user to save their cart and ultimately checkout with their purchases over a secure network  


## User Story 
AS a senior engineer working on an e-commerce platform<br>
I WANT my platform to use Redux to manage global state instead of the Context API<br>
SO THAT my website's state management is taken out of the React ecosystem<br>

## Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN an e-commerce platform that uses Redux to manage global state
WHEN I review the appâ€™s store
THEN I find that the app uses a Redux store instead of the Context API
WHEN I review the way the React front end accesses the store
THEN I find that the app uses a Redux provider
WHEN I review the way the app determines changes to its global state
THEN I find that the app passes reducers to a Redux store instead of using the Context API
WHEN I review the way the app extracts state data from the store
THEN I find that the app uses Redux instead of the Context API
WHEN I review the way the app dispatches actions
THEN I find that the app uses Redux instead of the Context API
